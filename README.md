# Checkers

This application is an interpretation of the famous game of Checkers.
During the game, each player owns checkers of the same color: black or white (sometimes other colors, one of which is considered dark, and the other-light). In this game, the user plays black, and the AI plays white. The goal of the game is to take all the opponent's checkers or to deprive them of the opportunity to move (lock).
In English checkers, each player has 12 checkers in the starting position, located in the first three rows on the black squares. With several options for taking the player chooses the option at his own discretion, in the selected option it is necessary to beat all the checkers available for taking.

The difference between the rules and Russian checkers:
1. Black makes the first move.
2. Simple checkers can only hit forward.
3. The king can go to one field diagonally forward or backward, when taking it goes only through one field in any direction, and not to any field diagonally, as in Russian checkers.

The game begins with a move of black checkers (a feature of these checkers) and continues until there are no enemy checkers left on the field. At the end of the game, a window appears with a message about who won in this game: the user or the AI? (The peculiarity of the AI intelligence of this game is that there is a 50 % chance of getting a draw).
